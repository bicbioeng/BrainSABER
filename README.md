#BrainSABER



This package contains tools to compare gene expression data to data from The Allen Institute for Brain Science BrainSpan Atlas. Facilitates comparisons of user data with the various developmental stages and brain structures found in the BrainSpan atlas and produces similarity matrices containing samples of the userâ€™s data analyzed against each sample in the BrainSpan database. These matrices are presented as dynamic heat maps, and include both cosine and Euclidean similarity methods.
