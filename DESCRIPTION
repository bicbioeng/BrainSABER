Description:  The Allen Institute for Brain Science provides an 
    RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data resource for studying 
    transcriptional mechanisms involved in human brain 
    development known as BrainSpan. BrainSABER is an R package that facilitates 
    comparison of user data with the various developmental stages and brain 
    structures found in the BrainSpan atlas by generating dynamic similarity 
    heatmaps for the two data sets. It also provides a self-validating container
    for user data.
